We got even more devs than the last jam! so this should go alright!

Its all the devs who worked on frostrial.
Ubre, Grodbert, rndtrash, NotGaylien, ceitine.
But we now have an actual mapper! wheatleymf!

This time around the theme was also pretty bland, last year it was "Winter" this year it was "horror/halloween",
we can work with that though!

## Cryptid hunt
We at smallfish have a fondness for cryptids, we even have a cryptozoology channel in our discord (at the time of this blog).
there is this one twitter that posts AI generated images of made up cryptids, one caught our eye, and we decided our game was going to be based around this none existent AI generated image of a cryptid.

## Some Models - Luke
This time i around i was not free to do much, so i only made a small handful of hard surface models.
you can view me making them on and off in a timelapse i recorded.
