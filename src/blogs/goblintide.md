Another Gamejam

All the devs from before are on board: Ubre, Grodbert, rndtrash, ceitine, NotGaylien, and wheatleymf. We've also welcomed a wonderful Australian UI programmer, Gio!

This time, the theme was a lot more creative: "Gangs."

It also allowed for more freedom, going beyond just traditional gangs. So, we decided to get creative with how we'd interpret that theme.

<Heading title="Wait... Goblins?" />

Enter goblins.

It's geniusâ€” who would expect goblins!

The concept revolves around being a goblin king, raiding villages for resources to expand your goblin army. The goal is to raid more villages, amass more resources, and become the greatest goblin king.

We aimed for a Clash of Clans-style gameplay, where players return every few hours or each day to gather energy between sessions for raiding. Unfortunately, this seemed to confuse people greatly, as they thought they had to abuse certain commands left in to get more energy. Whoops...

<Heading title="Clothes and Props" caption="by Luke" />

For the NPCs, I wanted them to genuinely resemble villagers. So, I made some clothes with variations to integrate our lovely NPCs seamlessly into their villages.

I also made all the destructible props and weapons in the game. These models are more detailed compared to previous jams, and I'm proud of how they turned out.

<Heading title="Particles" caption="by Luke" />

I created particles for breaking props and setting things on fire, also a magic wand particle. They're simple, but every game needs particles!

Those annoying screaming villagers... They're me.

They're all a British man making random gibberish noises.

I also recorded some quick tutorial narration voice lines to prevent the game from being too confusing.

Admittedly, I'm not cut out to be a voice actor.
