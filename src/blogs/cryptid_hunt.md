We have even more developers than the last jam, so this should go well!

Ubre, Grodbert, rndtrash, NotGaylien, and ceitine. Additionally, we now have an actual mapper, wheatleymf!

This time around the theme was pretty bland much like last years, last year it was "Winter" this year it was "horror/halloween",
we can work with that though!

At Smallfish, we have a fondness for cryptids and even have a cryptozoology channel on our Discord (at the time of this blog). There's a Twitter account that posts AI-generated images of made-up cryptids; one caught our eye, and we decided our game would be based on this nonexistent AI-generated image of a cryptid.

Due to time constraints, I only made a small handful of hard surface models. You can watch me making them on and off in a timelapse I recorded.

Unfortunately, this is all I could contribute for the jam.
