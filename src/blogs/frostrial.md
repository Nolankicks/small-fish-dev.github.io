## Fist ever Gamejam

We finished our first ever game jam while also become a team of devs!

Although smallfish was just Ubre and Grobert, during this gamejam hosted by - PERSON,

Luke(NotGaylien) and rndtrash joined and with a extra artist and programmer, we managed to smash out a full unique game!
We also managed to reel in a extra bonus ceitine right at the end!

+3 developers!

## The Game?

The premise is you are trapped in a frozen wasteland (Finland) on the edge of a frozen lake, wanting to escape you risk your life.
drilling holes in the ice and fishing to sell fish for money, hoping to buy a plane ticket to escape.
You can buy upgrades along the way to help you survive!

## PostProcessing - Luke
I threw together a dynamic freezing shader.
with a few layered effects.
- Edge of screen ice buildup
- colours fading away to grey
- bluring

these 3 effects will slowly creep in when you set a freezing value on the shader, allowing an effect of your "eyes" slowly freezing over, or rapidly "melting" away the ice.

This is a really nice visual indicator of how cold you are and how much more cold you can withstand before you lose.

## Props and Clothing - Luke
I really wanted custom clothing.

No game up to this point has done custom clothing, so i threw together some basic clothes that could be recoloured.
There isnt much detail, but you will never be close enough to see any detail anyway.

I also dealt with a any props and hard surface models, be that the fishing rods, tools, cabin, bench and so on.
these were all quick and easy pushed out models.

## Particles - Luke / Ubre
Every good games needs some particles.
So I (Luke) quickly threw together some 
- water particles
- nice stinky and flies particles ( this will help you to find tiny fish you might not be able to notice! )
