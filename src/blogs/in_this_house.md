Its that time of year, the winter/halloween jams have come upon us.

s&box is in an extremely shakey state so not many other groups survived this jam, alot fell out part way through.
we went strong though!

And we made one of our greatest games yet!!!

This time all the previous devs were here, except wheatleymf.
BUT! We have another dev joining us!!!

Ubre, Grodbert, Ceitine, rndtrash, Gio, NotGaylien...
And CyberAgent! who will be helping to do maps!

This time the theme was "Urban Legends"

## Whos house? What House?

We went hard into a retro psx style game, this would allow us more speed on the art side of things.
while also being able to mess big time with special post processing!

This idea was to have a dungeon crawler type gameplay, where you go in the mansion, and do multiple runs
and there are mutliple levels, each level is its own urban legend!

## Models, Models and... MORE MODELS - Luke
I decided to go as hard as possible making models this time around,
the psx style allowed me to mass produce models, so i made as many as i could.
We needed to fill 3 different maps with unique props and items. so i wanted to make sure they were not empty!
In the end there were 60 models!

## Materials - Luke
With this art style, there are not many materials around that fit it, we need all custom ones, with a custom shader!
So i went and made various materials that could be used around and about!

This was the first time i properly made many materials but they turned out pretty nice!

## Shop & Bathrooms Maps - Luke
So i saw we were going to fall behind on the shop and 3rd level.
I decided to step in and do them, i have never done maps before, but they are somewhat like models, so i tried my best!

I also had set up various prefabs for myself and cyber to use in the final 2 levels, they ended up really nice!
