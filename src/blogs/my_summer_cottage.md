This is our journey on the first s&box game contest. We all think we did pretty good...

<Heading title="Tools & Gizmos" caption="by ceitine and ubre" />
Me and ubre spent some time adding cool gizmos and tools for our game just to make it faster to push out content.
I think they're pretty important considering the fact that we want to keep working on this game in the future.

These tools helped us during the jam, and will keep doing so in the future.
The interaction bounds gizmos only ended up being used for the slot machine, but maybe in the future we'll want to use it for stuff like the radio buttons.

Wheatley did some amazing UI designs for everything and the rest of us tried our best to make it look as good.

Initially, I wasn't sure if the designs were a bit too ambitious for what we could do in a month, but I ended up doing most of the character creation on the first week's weekend. I did do adjustments and improvements to it through out the whole contest though.

Here are the initial UI designs by wheatley, and what I managed to turn them into.
