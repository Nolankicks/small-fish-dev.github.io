Another Gamejam! yep its that time!

All the devs from before.
Ubre, Grodbert, rndtrash, ceitine, NotGaylien, wheatleymf.
And we seemed to have aquired a wonderful Australian UI programmer!!!
Gio!

This time around the theme was alot more creative!

"Gangs" 

With this it mentioned groups of induviduals, and so on, so even more freedom than just a gang.
So we decided to go wild with the way we will use that theme...

## Wait... Goblins?
Goblins. Its genius, who would expect goblins!

The idea here is you are a goblin king, you raid vilalgers to get resources to expand your goblin army, and keep raiding more and more, getting more and more resoureces to become to greatest goblin king!

We tried to go more for a clash of clans style gameplay, where you come back every few hours or every day, to get more energy to raid another village,
but this seemed to have confused people greatley, and people thought they had to abuse commands left in to get more energy....

woops....

## Clothes and Props - Luke
The npcs i wanted to actually look like villagers, so i actually made some clothes and some variations of them to make our lovely npcs fit into their little villages!

Also i threw together all the destructable props and weapons within the game! 
These models are alot more detailed compared to the previous jams, so i am proud of how they look!

## Particles - Luke
I threw together some nice particles for breaking props, and setting things on fire.
also a magic wand particle!

these are pretty simple but every game needs particles!!!

## Voicelines - Luke
Those annoying screaming villagers... They are me... They are all british men making random gibberish noises...

I also did some quick tutorial narration voice lines, since i didnt want the game to be too confusing!

I am not cut out to be a voice actor...
